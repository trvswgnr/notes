Dear Hiring Manager,

As a software developer with over 10 years of experience developing robust solutions across the technology stack, I am confident in my ability to contribute to Rosenxt's mission of engineering excellence and innovative progress as a Senior Back-End Developer.

I am proficient in modern backend technologies and development patterns, with particular expertise in Python and cloud platforms. My experience includes developing and deploying scalable applications using Python, Node.js, and .NET, along with implementing microservice architectures and working with both SQL and NoSQL databases. Code quality and maintainability are fundamental to my work, and I always strive to create efficient, scalable solutions that stand the test of time. My experience with containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, coupled with my understanding of DevOps practices and cloud platforms like Azure, enables me to build and deploy robust backend systems that meet the demanding requirements of industrial and enterprise applications.

What sets me apart from other candidates is my ability to quickly master new technologies and apply them effectively in challenging environments. I stay current with emerging backend technologies and best practices, allowing me to make informed architectural decisions that drive innovation. I'm particularly excited about the opportunity to work on cutting-edge projects in areas like sensors, autonomous robotics, and AI at Rosenxt.

In terms of specific experience, I have worked extensively with REST and gRPC-based services, implementing complex backend systems that handle data sharing and cross-region replication. My strong background in test-driven development and continuous integration practices ensures the delivery of high-quality, maintainable code. Furthermore, I have experience mentoring junior developers and contributing to product vision, which aligns well with Rosenxt's collaborative culture.

I am drawn to Rosenxt's commitment to creating sustainable value and its focus on solving challenging technical problems in critical industries. While my formal education is in Music Production from Full Sail University, my decade of hands-on engineering experience and continuous learning demonstrate my deep technical capabilities and passion for technology. I believe my diverse background would bring a unique perspective to your team of interdisciplinary engineers.

I am excited about the possibility of contributing to Rosenxt's innovative projects and working with your team of tech enthusiasts. I am fully prepared for the travel requirements and look forward to participating in regular workshops in Columbus, Ohio.

Best regards, Travis Wagner
